description: "The 14 plane ride, and our first night in Tokyo"
---

We boarded the plane, which was a Boeing 777 and one of the larger planes I have ever been on. We took off for our 14 hour flight after what felt like an hour delay on the tarmac. The main cabin seats wear comfortable enough and had more space than a Spirit flight. It was a mostly full plane however the seat next to me managed to be empty.  The flight was very smooth with Minimal turbulence. Two hours after take off the crew began to inundate us with food options. First it was a small bag of trail mix, then sweet and sour chicken and rice with a side of couscous salad, next it was a turkey sandwich, and then a breakfast option of pancakes and chicken sausage or turkey sausage, egg, and potato scramble and a side of fruit salad. All food options were quickly followed by beverage options. I found my self eating more than I would had I not been on a flight.

Landing in Tokyo I found the customs and entry procedure to be very stream lined and more personable than other airports I’ve visited. Although this may be related to traveling with one bag. The entry procedure must have taken 20 mins total.

Leaving the airport (Narita), we first looked to see what the cost was for an Uber to the hotel in Asakusa. It was 250 dollars for a 45 min Uber black ride, so we decided we would take the trains. The train was 11 dollars each and took approximately 1 hr with a 10 min walk. 

Getting off the train we had to walk thru Asakusa Market which has a lot of small shops and eateries with seating on the street. The market seemed to filled with locals going about their day. Our hotel was situated north of the market, about two blocks away from the Senso-Ji temple. 

After dropping off our bags at the hotel room we immediately left out to explore the shops in Asakusa and search for Halal ramen.  We went to Naritaya Halal Ramen which was  about a block away from where our hotel was located. I ordered the beef based Ramen and Marcus tried the Chicken, and both were pretty good. 

After Ramen we set out to take in a little bit more of the area. We went into various shops and a mall. At about 8-9 o’clock, the sun had set, and the area was bustling with people. We ended up looking far a bar to get some sake and arrived at Hub. Hub is a bar which branded its self as a "New Orleans, Bourbon Street jazz club". Just about all of the customers were over the age of 50. The music was really good and the atmosphere was great. We order a bottle of sake for about 35 dollars and quickly learned  that we wouldn’t be able to finish it before the club closed at 11:30. We debated putting that bottle in our jacket and leaving with it. After speaking with the waiter we learned that the would put a label on the bottle and keep it for us until we returned another day. I thought this was cool as I haven’t been anywhere that offered this service before. We were both tired and feeling the affects of multiple shots of sake and retired to the hotel for the night.
