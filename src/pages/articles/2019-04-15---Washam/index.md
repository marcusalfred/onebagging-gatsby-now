Hi,

My name is Marcus and I've decided to blog about my experiences traveling minimally. This blog will cover minimalism, travel, and gear. My like minded friend [Sadiq](https://bagging.one/sadiq/), will also be be an author of this blog. We will be traveling together soon and hope to give some ideas on how you can enjoy travel more by carrying less and packing intentionally.

- Marcus
