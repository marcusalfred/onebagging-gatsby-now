# The Trip
In the Fall of 2017, I started working for a awesome company, Lucid. When the offer came in, I was ecstatic. It would mean working in the Tech industry, in New Orleans, making more money than I've ever made. Fast Forward to today, I'm making even more money, and I've learned so much. I received a pretty nice bonus for  the mid-year reviews (shout out to Brandi!) and my financial advisor, my wife - Sydnie, allowed me to put some money aside for a solo vacation. All I had to do now was wait for a sweet deal on Scott's Cheap Flights. Boom! $650 for NYC -> Tokyo -> Bangkok -> NYC! I snatched it up as quick as possible. I shared my plans with my friend group, and my friend Sadiq also booked the trip.

## New York - 12 Hours
We arrive to JFK on Monday at 23:30EST. Our flight from EWR to NRT (Tokyo), Departs at 11:05EST.  We have not booked a room and don't plan on it. Instead, we plan to visit the Empire State Building before it closes at 02:00EST, grab a New York slice, and take in the sights. Once we've had enough, we'll head to the airport and check into one EWRs lounges, which I get access to because of my Chase Sapphire Reserve Card, for rest and snacks until our flight departs.

## Tokyo - 6 Days
On the 15th we arrive in Tokyo and have nothing planned for the day after a 14 Hour flight. On the 16th, we plan on visting Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The 17th, will include a visit to a tea experience and some kayaking. Theres also a Beer Festival during the time we are there and we'll probably check it out. Some other items on our list include shopping, a steampunk arcade, a Samurai Festival, a rest area that hosts car meetups, and kayaking.

## Phuket / Koh Phi Phi - 3 Days
We travel to Bangkok on the 21st and Will leave immediately to Phuket. I plan while there is to relax and maybe do a little fishing and kayaking.

## Bangkok - 3 Days
We get to Bangkok on the 24th and don't really have much planned.
