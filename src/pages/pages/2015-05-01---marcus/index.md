## Minimal Travel
Traveling is the greatest form of education. You learn about other people, their cultures and you learn about yourself. Through travel I've learned that we are all apart of one big community. I am more aware of my surroundings (for the good and the bad). And I've learned that I often overpack, to the detriment of my time and energy.

I like to consider myself a minimal person and have begun to incorporate this into my traveling. I own 2 Tom Bihn bags that my wife and I share when traveling. I've slowly introduced her to the idea of minimal travel and she has begun to see and appreciate its advantages.

## Background
I hail from New Orleans, Louisiana, where I've lived 2/3rds of my life. I was born and raised in the river parishes of rural New Orleans and moved Uptown with my mother and sisters before my teenage years. We had Family near Los Angeles and in Chicago, so on occasion we would travel there.
